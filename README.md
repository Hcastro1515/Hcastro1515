👋 Hey there! I'm @Hcastro1515, a passionate software developer who loves learning new technologies. 

💡 My interests extend beyond just coding. I enjoy watching Anime and exploring various music genres in my free time, which adds a creative edge to my technical skills.

🌱 I'm skilled in C#/.NET Core, but I'm not one to rest on my laurels. I'm constantly pushing my boundaries and presently, I'm diving deep into Node.js and Express.

🔍 Keen on contributing to open source projects, I'm always looking for exciting opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow.

🎯 While I'm focused on becoming a more versatile developer, I also believe in sharing what I learn. So, if you're working on something interesting or need help, don't hesitate to reach out!

📫 You can connect with me at Hcastro1015@gmail.com. 

Happy coding! 😄
